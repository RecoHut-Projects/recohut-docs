  "description": "DRQN stands for Deep Recurrent Q-Learning. It is a combination of a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a deep Q-network (DQN). The idea being that the RNN will be able to retain information from states further back in time and incorporate that into predicting better Q values and thus performing better on games that require long term planning.",

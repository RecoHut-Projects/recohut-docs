  "description": "In our recommendation platform, items are shown in cascade on a mobile App one by one. Each time the user initiates a request, 50 items are recommended to him/her. As user scrolls down the list and have seen all 50 items, a new request is triggered. �is process is repeated until the user leaves the App or return the top of the cascade, labelled as ”exit” in Figure 2. We use a metric called ”pageid” to distinguish diferent requests in this interaction, similar to the concept of ”page” to a search engine. As the user and the system interact with each other, the system learns how to respond to the state to obtain an optimized accumulative reward.",

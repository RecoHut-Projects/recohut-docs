  "description": "Here is an excerpt from the book The Long Tail by Chris Anderson: \"In 1988, a British mountain climber named Joe Simpson wrote a book called Touching the Void, a harrowing account of near-death in the Peruvian Andes. It got good reviews but, only a modest success, it was soon forgotten. Then, a decade later, a strange thing happened. Jon Krakauer wrote Into Thin Air, another book about a mountain-c√§mbing tragedy, which became a publishing sensation. Suddenly Touching the Void started to sell again\".",

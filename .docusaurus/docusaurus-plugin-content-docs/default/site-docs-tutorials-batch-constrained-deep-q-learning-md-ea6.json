  "description": "Current off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithms fail to address extrapolation error by selecting actions with respect to a learned value estimate, without consideration of the accuracy of the estimate. As a result, certain outof-distribution actions can be erroneously extrapolated to higher values. However, the value of an off-policy agent can be accurately evaluated in regions where data is available.",

  "description": "DeepFM stands for Deep Factorization Machines. It consists of an FM component and a deep component which are integrated in a parallel structure. The FM component is the same as the 2-way factorization machines which is used to model the low-order feature interactions. The deep component is a multi-layered perceptron that is used to capture high-order feature interactions and nonlinearities. These two components share the same inputs/embeddings and their outputs are summed up as the final prediction.",

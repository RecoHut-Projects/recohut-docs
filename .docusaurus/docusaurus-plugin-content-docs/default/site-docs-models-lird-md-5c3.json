  "description": "Existing reinforcement learning recommender methods also could recommend a list of items. E.g. DQN can calculate Q-values of all recalled items separately, and recommend a list of items with highest Q-values. But these recommendations are similar in Euclidean space and we want to find similarity in associative space. For instance, for a bread 🍞, I want egg 🥚, milk 🥛 in my recommendation list instead of white bread 🍞, brown bread 🥪, bun 🫓 etc.",

  "description": "In this tutorial, we will first fetch the data from Spotify API, then preprocess it and perform EDA. After that we will train a genre predictor model and replace the Spotify's predicted genre with our predicted values. We are doing this replacement because Spotify uses artist's information also in predicting genres but we are building a song recommender that find similar songs purely on the basis of song features because using artist's info adds a fairness bias to the recommendations. Spotify gets higher accuracy but at the cost of fairness to the artists. After building genre classification model, we will train a KNN model, a non-personalized memory-based model, to find top-k similar songs.",

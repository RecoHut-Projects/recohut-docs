  "description": "Metrics like Hit Rate provide only a partial picture of the expected behavior of recommenders in the wild: two models with very similar accuracy can have very different behavior on, say, the long-tail, or model A can be better than model B overall, but at the expense of providing disastrous performance on a set of inputs that are particularly important in production. Metrics such as coverage, serendipity, and bias have been therefore proposed to capture other aspects of the behaviors of RSs, but they still fall short of what is needed to debug RSs in production, or provide any guarantee that a model will be reliable when released.",

  "description": "CASER stands for Convolutional Sequence Embedding Recommendation. Top-N sequential recommendation models each user as a sequence of items interacted in the past and aims to predict top-N ranked items that a user will likely interact in a 'near future'. The order of interaction implies that sequential patterns play an important role where more recent items in a sequence have a larger impact on the next item. Convolutional Sequence Embedding Recommendation Model (Caser) address this requirement by embedding a sequence of recent items into an image' in the time and latent spaces and learn sequential patterns as local features of the image using convolutional filters. This approach provides a unified and flexible network structure for capturing both general preferences and sequential patterns. In other words, Caser adopts convolutional neural networks capture the dynamic pattern influences of usersâ€™ recent activities.",

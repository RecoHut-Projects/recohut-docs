  "description": "Context is similar to a state in a multi-step reinforcement learning (RL) problem, with one key difference. In a multi-step RL problem, the action an agent takes affects the states it is likely to visit in the subsequent steps. For example, while playing tic-tac-toe, an agent's action in the current state changes the board configuration (state) in a particular way, which then affects what actions the opponent can take, and so on. In CB problems, however, the agent simply observes the context, makes a decision, and observes the reward. The next context the agent will observe does not depend on the current context/action. This setup, although simpler than multi-step RL, occurs in a very broad set of applications.",

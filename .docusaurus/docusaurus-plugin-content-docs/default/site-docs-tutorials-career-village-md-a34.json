  "description": "Weâ€™ll develop an implicit content-based filtering system for recommending questions to professionals. Given a question-professional pair, our model will predict how likely the professional is to answer the question. This model can then be used to determine what new (or still-unanswered) questions a professional is most likely to answer, and those questions can be sent to the professional either via email or via their landing page on the CareerVillage site.",

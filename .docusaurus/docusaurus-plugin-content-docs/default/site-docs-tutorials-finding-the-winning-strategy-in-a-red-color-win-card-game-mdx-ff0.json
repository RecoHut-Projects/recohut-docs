  "description": "Would you like to win a bit of money? Let’s wager on a card game for minor stakes. In front of you is a shuffled deck of cards. All 52 cards lie face down. Half the cards are red, and half are black. I will proceed to flip over the cards one by one. If the last card I flip over is red, you’ll win a dollar. Otherwise, you’ll lose a dollar.",

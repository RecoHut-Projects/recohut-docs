  "description": "VSKNN stands for Vector Multiplication Session-Based kNN. The idea of this variant is to put more emphasis on the more recent events of a session when computing the similarities. Instead of encoding a session as a binary vector, we use real-valued vectors to encode the current session. Only the very last element of the session obtains a value of “1”; the weights of the other elements are determined using a linear decay function that depends on the position of the element within the session, where elements appearing earlier in the session obtain a lower weight. As a result, when using the dot product as a similarity function between the current weight-encoded session and a binary-encoded past session, more emphasis is given to elements that appear later in the sessions.",

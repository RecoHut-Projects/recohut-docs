  "description": "A recent business model trend is to automatically deliver products to customers and allow them to return those that they are not interested in. Stitch Fix is one of the most famous of the subscription box model businesses. After submitting a smorgasbord of initial information about body type and personal preferences, a Stitch Fix customer will be sent a package full of new clothes. The customer is then free to send back any clothes they donâ€™t like and they are charged for the items they keep (plus a service fee).",

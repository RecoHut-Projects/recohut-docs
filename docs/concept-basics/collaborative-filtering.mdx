## Similarity methods

### User-based similarity

Let's take the following user-item rating matrix as an example:

| UserID/ItemID | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4 | 5 | 6   | Mean Rating |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|---|---|-----|-------------|
| 1      | 7   | 6   | 7   | 4 | 5 | 4   | 5.5         |
| 2      | 6   | 7   | NaN | 4 | 3 | 4   | 4.8         |
| 3      | NaN | 3   | 3   | 1 | 1 | NaN | 2           |
| 4      | 1   | 2   | 2   | 3 | 3 | 4   | 2.5         |
| 5      | 1   | NaN | 1   | 2 | 3 | 3   | 2           |


For each user, mean rating is calculated as follows:

$$ \mu_u = \frac{\Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{I}_u} r_{uk}}{|\mathcal{I}_u|} \ \ \forall u \in \{1 \dots m\} $$


Two common approaches to measure similarity between two users $\mathrm{Sim}(u, v)$ are *Cosine similarity* and *Pearson correlation coefficient*:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Cosine}(u,v) &= \frac{\Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{I}_u \cap \mathcal{I}_v} r_{uk} * r_{vk}}{\sqrt{\Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{I}_u \cap \mathcal{I}_v} r_{uk}^2} * \sqrt{\Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{I}_u \cap \mathcal{I}_v} r_{vk}^2}} \\
\mathrm{Pearson}(u,v) &= \frac{\Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{I}_u \cap \mathcal{I}_v} (r_{uk} - \mu_u) * (r_{vk} - \mu_v)}{\sqrt{\Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{I}_u \cap \mathcal{I}_v} (r_{uk} - \mu_u)^2} * \sqrt{\Sigma_{k \in \mathcal{I}_u \cap \mathcal{I}_v} (r_{vk} - \mu_v)^2}}
\end{align*}


For example, given the original rating matrix, between *User 1* and *User 3* we have their similarities as:

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Cosine}(1,3) &= \frac{6*3+7*3+4*1+5*1}{\sqrt{6^2+7^2+4^2+5^2} * \sqrt{3^2+3^2+1^2+1^2}} = 0.956 \\
\mathrm{Pearson}(1,3) &= \frac{(6 - 5.5) * (3 - 2) + (7 - 5.5) * (3 - 2) + (4 - 5.5) * (1 - 2) + (5 - 5.5) * (1 - 2)}{\sqrt{0.5^2 + 1.5^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (-0.5)^2} * \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2}} = 0.894
\end{align*}

The overall neighborhood-based *prediction function* is as follows:

$$ \hat{r}_{uj} = \mu_u + \frac{\Sigma_{v \in P_u(j)} \mathrm{Sim}(u,v) * (r_{vj} - \mu_v)}{\Sigma_{v \in P_u(j)} |\mathrm{Sim}(u,v)|} $$


For example, to calculate the predicted rating given by *User 3* to *Item 1* and *Item 6*, where the ratings are based on the two nearest neighbors (*User 1* and *User 2*):

\begin{align*}
\hat{r}_{31} &= 2 + \frac{1.5*0.894+1.2*0.939}{0.894 + 0.939} = 3.35 \\
\hat{r}_{36} &= 2 + \frac{-1.5*0.894-0.8*0.939}{0.894 + 0.939} = 0.86
\end{align*}


### Item-based similarity

The *Cosine* and *Pearson* similarities can be applied for item-based methods as well, except that the feature vectors are now columns instead of rows as we measure similarity between items. 

If *Cosine* similarity is based on the mean-centered rating matrix, we have a variant called *AdjustedCosine*.  The *adjusted* cosine similarity between the items (columns) *i* and *j* is defined as follows:

$$ \mathrm{AdjustedCosine}(i,j) = \frac{\Sigma_{u \in \mathcal{U}_i \cap \mathcal{U}_j} s_{ui} * s_{uj}}{\sqrt{\Sigma_{u \in \mathcal{U}_i \cap \mathcal{U}_j} s_{ui}^2} * \sqrt{\Sigma_{u \in \mathcal{U}_i \cap \mathcal{U}_j} s_{uj}^2}} $$

where $s_{ui}$ is the mean-centered rating that user $u$ gives to item $i$. 

For example, we calculate *adjusted* cosine between *Item 1* and *Item 3* in the small sample dataset above as follows:

$$ \mathrm{AdjustedCosine}(1,3) = \frac{1.5 * 1.5 + (-1.5) * (-0.5) + (-1) * (-1)}{\sqrt{1.5^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (-1)^2} * \sqrt{1.5^2 + (-0.5)^2 + (-1)^2}} = 0.912 $$

For prediction, we use the same form of prediction function as in user-based methods but aggregate the user's ratings on neighboring items:

$$ \hat{r}_{ut} = \mu_u + \frac{\Sigma_{j \in Q_t(u)} \mathrm{Sim}(j,t) * (r_{uj} - \mu_u)}{\Sigma_{j \in Q_t(u)} |\mathrm{Sim}(j,t)|} $$


For example, below we predict the ratings that *User 3* would give to *Item 1* and *Item 6*. The rating for *Item 1* is based on two nearest neighbors *Item 2* and *Item 3*, while the rating for *Item 6* is based on *Item 4* and *Item 5*.

\begin{align*}
\hat{r}_{31} &= 2 + \frac{1*0.735 + 1*0.912}{0.735 + 0.912} = 3 \\
\hat{r}_{36} &= 2 + \frac{(-1)*0.829 + (-1)*0.730}{0.829 + 0.730} = 1
\end{align*}

# Transformers4Rec XLNet on Synthetic data 
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region id="f0f8b4e3" -->
In this tutorial we introduce the [Transformers4Rec](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Transformers4Rec) library for sequential and session-based recommendation. This tutorial uses the PyTorch API, but a TensorFlow API is also available. Transformers4Rec integrates with the popular [HuggingFaceâ€™s Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and make it possible to experiment with cutting-edge implementation of the latest NLP Transformer architectures.  

We demonstrate how to build a session-based recommendation model with the [XLNET](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237) Transformer architecture. The XLNet architecture was designed to leverage the best of both auto-regressive language modeling and auto-encoding with its Permutation Language Modeling training method. In this example we will use XLNET with masked language modeling (MLM) training method, which showed very promising results.

First, we are going to generate synthetic data and then create sequential features with [NVTabular](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/NVTabular). Such data will be used to train a session-based recommendation model.

NVTabular is a feature engineering and preprocessing library for tabular data designed to quickly and easily manipulate terabyte scale datasets used to train deep learning based recommender systems. It provides a high level abstraction to simplify code and accelerates computation on the GPU using the RAPIDS cuDF library.

## Feature Engineering with NVTabular
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region id="139de226" -->
Deep Learning models require dense input features. Categorical features are sparse, and need to be represented by dense embeddings in the model. To allow for that, categorical features need first to be encoded as contiguous integers `(0, ..., |C|)`, where `|C|` is the feature cardinality (number of unique values), so that their embeddings can be efficiently stored in embedding layers.  We will use NVTabular to preprocess the categorical features, so that all categorical columns are encoded as contiguous integers.  Note that in the `Categorify` op we set `start_index=1`, the reason for that we want the encoded null values to start from `1` instead of `0` because we reserve `0` for padding the sequence features.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region id="55b3bb9c" -->
Here our goal is to create sequential features.  In this cell, we are creating temporal features and grouping them together at the session level, sorting the interactions by time. Note that we also trim each feature sequence in a  session to a certain length. Here, we use the NVTabular library so that we can easily preprocess and create features on GPU with a few lines.

We have created session-level features to train a session-based recommendation model using NVTabular. Now we will train a session-based recommendation model using [XLNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237), one of the state-of-the-art NLP model.

Transformers4Rec library relies on a schema object to automatically build all necessary layers to represent, normalize and aggregate input features. As you can see below, `schema.pb` is a protobuf file that contains metadata including statistics about features such as cardinality, min and max values and also tags features based on their characteristics and dtypes (e.g., categorical, continuous, list, integer).

## Define the sequential input module
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region id="985341a3" -->
Below we define our `input` block using the `TabularSequenceFeatures` [class](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Transformers4Rec/blob/main/transformers4rec/torch/features/sequence.py#L91). The `from_schema()` method processes the schema and creates the necessary layers to represent features and aggregate them. It keeps only features tagged as `categorical` and `continuous` and supports data aggregation methods like `concat` and `elementwise-sum` techniques. It also support data augmentation techniques like stochastic swap noise. It outputs an interaction representation after combining all features and also the input mask according to the training task (more on this later).

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region id="8d0532bc" -->
The `max_sequence_length` argument defines the maximum sequence length of our sequential input, and if `continuous_projection` argument is set, all numerical features are concatenated and projected by an MLP block so that continuous features are represented by a vector of size defined by user, which is `64` in this example.
<!-- #endregion -->

```python id="0b2d13d0"
inputs = tr.TabularSequenceFeatures.from_schema(
        schema,
        max_sequence_length=20,
        continuous_projection=64,
        d_output=100,
        masking="mlm",
)
```

<!-- #region id="54260cd3" -->
The output of the `TabularSequenceFeatures` module is the sequence of interactions embeddings vectors defined in the following steps:
- 1. Create sequence inputs: If the schema contains non sequential features, expand each feature to a sequence by repeating the value as many as the `max_sequence_length` value.  
- 2. Get a representation vector of categorical features: Project each sequential categorical feature using the related embedding table. The resulting tensor is of shape (bs, max_sequence_length, embed_dim).
- 3. Project scalar values if `continuous_projection` is set : Apply an MLP layer with hidden size equal to `continuous_projection` vector size value. The resulting tensor is of shape (batch_size, max_sequence_length, continuous_projection).
- 4. Aggregate the list of features vectors to represent each interaction in the sequence with one vector: For example, `concat` will concat all vectors based on the last dimension `-1` and the resulting tensor will be of shape (batch_size, max_sequence_length, D) where D is the sum over all embedding dimensions and the value of continuous_projection. 
- 5. If masking schema is set (needed only for the NextItemPredictionTask training), the masked labels are derived from the sequence of raw item-ids and the sequence of interactions embeddings are processed to mask information about the masked positions.

In the next cell, the whole model is build with a few lines of code. 
Here is a brief explanation of the main classes:  
- [XLNetConfig](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Transformers4Rec/blob/main/transformers4rec/config/transformer.py#L261) - We have injected in the HF transformers config classes like `XLNetConfig`the `build()` method, that provides default configuration to Transformer architectures for session-based recommendation. Here we use it to instantiate and configure an XLNET architecture.  
- [TransformerBlock](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Transformers4Rec/blob/main/transformers4rec/torch/block/transformer.py#L37) class integrates with HF Transformers, which are made available as a sequence processing module for session-based and sequential-based recommendation models.  
- [NextItemPredictionTask](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Transformers4Rec/blob/main/transformers4rec/torch/model/head.py#L238) supports the next-item prediction task. We also support other predictions [tasks](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/Transformers4Rec/blob/main/transformers4rec/torch/model/head.py), like classification and regression for the whole sequence.

We have extended the HuggingFace transformers `Trainer` class (PyTorch only) to support evaluation of RecSys metrics. In this example, the evaluation of the session-based recommendation model is performed using traditional Top-N ranking metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@20) and Hit Rate (HR@20). NDCG accounts for rank of the relevant item in the recommendation list and is a more fine-grained metric than HR, which only verifies whether the relevant item is among the top-n items. HR@n is equivalent to Recall@n when there is only one relevant item in the recommendation list.

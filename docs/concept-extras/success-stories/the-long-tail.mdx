# The Long Tail

Here is an excerpt from the book ***The Long Tail*** by **Chris Anderson**: "In 1988, a British mountain climber named Joe Simpson wrote a book called ***Touching the Void***, a harrowing account of near-death in the Peruvian Andes. It got good reviews but, only a modest success, it was soon forgotten. Then, a decade later, a strange thing happened. Jon Krakauer wrote ***Into Thin Air***, another book about a mountain-c√§mbing tragedy, which became a publishing sensation. Suddenly ***Touching the Void*** started to sell again".

The demand for ***Touching the Void*** was so high that it even outsold ***Into Thin Air*** after some time. But what exactly happened here? Well, it turns out that since both the books were based on the same theme, Amazon suggested that readers who liked ***Into Thin Air*** would also like ***Touching the Void***. When people took in the suggestions they actually liked the book and as a result, wrote positive reviews which resulted in more sales ultimately leading to more recommendations and thereby kicking in a positive feedback loop. This is the power of recommendation systems.

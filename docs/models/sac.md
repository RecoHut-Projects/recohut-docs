# SAC

SAS stands for Soft Actor-Critic. It not only boasts of being more sample efficient than traditional RL algorithms but also promises to be robust to brittleness in convergence.

Not only does the Minotaur Robot learn in a really short time duration but it also learns to generalize to conditions that it hasnâ€™t seen during training! SAC thus brings us ever so close to using Reinforcement Learning in non-simulation environments for applications in robotics and other domains.

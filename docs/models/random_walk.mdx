# Random Walk

The term "random walk" was first mentioned by Karl Pearson in 1905 in a letter to Nature magazine titled **[The Problem of the Random Walk](https://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/pearson/index.html)**. Study of random walks date back even further to the **[Gambler’s ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin)** problem, where it could be used to show that a gambler would eventually go bankrupt against an opponent with infinite wealth. It’s only in the last couple of decades, however, that researchers have studied them with respect to networks.

Random Walk is an algorithm that provides random paths in a graph. A random walk means that we start at one node, choose a neighbor to navigate to at random or based on a provided probability distribution, and then do the same from that node, keeping the resulting path in a list. It’s similar to how a drunk person traverses a city.

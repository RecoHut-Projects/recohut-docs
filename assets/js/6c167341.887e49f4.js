In the App Store, there exist tens or hundreds of thousands of apps. If all the apps are involved for recommendation, the latency is unacceptable in practice, because it takes time to predict the matching score between a user and all the apps. Therefore, the candidate selection module is needed to select several hundred apps from the universal set for each user. Then the matching module predicts the matching score between a user and the selected apps representing the user\u2019s preference on them. Lastly, the ranking module produces the ranking list based on the matching scores and other principles (diversity and business rules)."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,(0,s.kt)("img",{alt:"Pipeline of the APP recommendation system.",src:n(56069).Z})),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Pipeline of the APP recommendation system."),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"We sample and collect 22 consecutive days of user-app download records from the game recommendation scenario. A user-item bipartite graph is constructed based on the download records. Two types of nodes (user nodes and item nodes) exist and an edge between a user node and an item node is included if there is an associated download record. App features (e.g., identification and category) and user features (e.g., click/browse/search history) are used as node features in the graph. As can be observed from the figure above, a GCN model (i.e., a simplified version of MGCCF) has been deployed in the candidate selection module. MGCCF learns an embedding for each user as well as each item. Then, candidates for each user are generated by finding the most similar items by computing the similarity between user and item embedding. The model employed in the candidate selection module of our recommender system is trained on 14 days\u2019 data, which is referred to as \u201cbatch mode\u201d. Based on the collected 22 days\u2019 data, we test the performance of \u201cbatch mode\u201d in a sliding window manner.

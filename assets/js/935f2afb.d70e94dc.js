construction of effective Recommender Systems (RS) is a complex process, mainly due to the nature of RSs which involves large scale software-systems and human interactions. Iterative development processes require deep understanding of a current baseline as well as the ability to estimate the impact of changes in multiple variables of interest. Simulations are well suited to address both challenges and potentially leading to a high velocity construction process, a fundamental requirement in commercial contexts.

A bias is a prejudice against a person or group of people, including, but not limited to their gender, race, and beliefs. Many of these biases arise from emergent behavior in social interactions, events in history, and cultural and political views around the world. These biases affect the data that we collect. Because AI algorithms work with this data, it is an inherent problem that the machine will \u201clearn\u201d these biases. From a technical perspective, we can engineer the system perfectly, but at the end of the day, humans interact with these systems, and it\u2019s our responsibility to minimize bias and prejudice as much as possible. The algorithms we use are only as good as the data provided to them. Understanding the data and the context in which it is being used is the first step in battling bias, and this understanding will help you build better solutions\u2014because you will be well versed in the problem space.

For example, 500 hours of new videos are uploaded to YouTube every minute, 500,000 new users register in Facebook every day, and web/mobile apps face the daily challenge of onboarding new users and subscribers. To provide recommendations for these new users and items, many content-based methods and heuristic methods have been deployed, e.g., recommending popular items or geographically near items.

Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"datasets":{"id":"datasets","title":"Datasets","description":"| Title | Link | Description |","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"A typical recommender system takes the training sample in the form","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"models/a3c":{"id":"models/a3c","title":"A3C","description":"A3C stands for Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic.

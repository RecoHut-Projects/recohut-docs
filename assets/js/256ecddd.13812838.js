The size was 30K. They also tried an alternative method based on BERT. They fine-tuned a BERT model on description text. The size of this embedding is 786. They mainly faced 3 challenges here - 1) meta-info is inconsistent and sparse, 2) detailed text description was available for ~20% of catalogue, and 3) longer pieces of text can't be encoded in pre-trained BERT model. So they tried another alternative based on graph networks. In this, they first used deepwalk algorithm to generate fabricated sequences of user sessions. It helped not only in combating non-homogeneity in items, but also helped in balanced sampling between popular and unpopular items. They they applied word2vec on these fabricated sesions to learn the embeddings. But still the performance was not good enough.

But this approach was not scalable beyond few million users. Then they used item-item association-rule mining. It is computationally cheap and used for 64% of users who had previous item interactions. It increased CTR by whopping 250%, and this was highly scalable to solve cold-start issue. But it reduced conversion by 5% over static-list baseline. Then they started moving towards deep learning approaches and tried neural collaborative filtering. This was also scalable to million of users. It covered 18% of users (compared to 64% in association rule-mining) with 5+ item interactions to get better results. It increased add-to-cart conversions by 300%, and CTR by 20%. But this approach was not able to solve the cold-start issue. Now, they started using next-event-prediction models. It uses user-item temporal sequences + item meta information. It is capable of real-time learning and gives better cold-start performance. The final results are yet to come but method look promising. Also, they show similar products on item page by directly using cosine similarity metric on embeddings. TF-IDF gave 6.5% increase in CTR, and prod2vec improved by additional 15% on top of TF-IDF.

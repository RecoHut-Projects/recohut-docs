A common approach to address this is to develop well articulated hypotheses about issues (e.g. current serving approach has high latency leading to higher abandonment rate) or opportunities for improvement (e.g. point-wise ranker produces low diversity leading to very similar recommendations) in the current version, and use existing or new data to validate them. Unfortunately in many cases this is not possible, because the available data is not appropriate, or because gathering new data is too expensive."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Once a concrete improvement opportunity is detected, the current system is modified accordingly, for example by changing a prediction algorithm, the user interface or the serving infrastructure. These are usually local interventions with measurable local effects. But they also have (and they are expected to have) global or system-wide effects, which are a lot harder to measure since they involve the system as a whole. On top of this, there is usually tension between various variables of interest such as relevance vs latency, or diversity vs relevance or adaptivity vs user satisfaction to name a few which further increases the importance of system-wide analysis. The ability to make good and principled trade-offs is key to deliver a balanced and robust recommender system."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"In e-commerce, the number of products in the shelf space are practically infinite.

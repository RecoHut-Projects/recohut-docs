Before each attention and feed-forward layer we have a batch-normalization layer. After each layer, we have a dropout layer with a dropout chance of 0.5 to reduce overfitting. On top of the encoder we have a feed-forward layer followed by a softmax layer, which are used to predict the probability of an item owned in the last month. An item is considered as owned if it probability is > 0.5. Similarly, acquired items can be predicted by excluding the items owned in the previous month from the original predictions. Therefore, the model learns using a binary cross entropy loss function and Adam as optimizer. Regarding the learning rate, they adopted a Rectified-Adam warm-up scheduling for the learning rate, with a peak after 10 epochs and decay until the 100th epoch when the training process terminates. Having a warm-up scheduling assures to have a higher learning rate at the beginning of the training when the parameters of the model are still far from the optimum. After a certain peak it gradually decreases to provide a more stable training."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0},8122:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-case-studies-raw-case-studies-santander-banking-products-untitled-1-9acc1f15a4d4eb6d9da03c64b483ec61.png"},3789:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/content-concepts-case-studies-raw-case-studies-santander-banking-products-untitled-d441054b9ba83e9c5c5b2ca5000184db.png"}}]);

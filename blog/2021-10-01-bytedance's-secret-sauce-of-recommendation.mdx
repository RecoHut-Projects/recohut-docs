For those who have been envious of [ByteDance’s](https://en.pingwest.com/search/bytedance) immense success across its various consumer products, and more specifically, the recommendation algorithms powering those products, there is finally good news.

**With a new brand called [Volcano Engine,](https://www.volcengine.com/) ByteDance is now making the technologies that drove the success of TikTok, Douyin, Toutiao, etc., available as a commercialized service to enterprise clients for the first time.**

Volcano Engine is a suite of services that purportedly assembles the “tools, technologies, and methodology” of ByteDance’s growth legend, covering its recommendation algorithms, audio-visual technologies, data insight services, cloud computing solutions, and more. It is quite literally a copy of the ByteDance's growth hacking “secret sauce”.

The intelligent recommendation service relies on the advanced large-scale machine learning and personalized recommendation technology of Volcano Engine. It has the ability to accumulate in information and information, live video, social networking, e-commerce and other fields, and provides customized recommendation algorithm services for partners. Improve core business indicators and create value through algorithmic capabilities

Volcano Engine-Intelligent Recommendation Service has been applied in many industries. Through in-depth mining and intelligent analysis of user behavior data, personalized content distribution and recommended product. Intelligent recommendation service has helped partners achieve a 150% increase in CTR in specific scenarios, 180% increase in advertising revenue in cooperation scenarios, helping partners understand users better

### **Data description**

For customers in the e-commerce industry, 3 data sheets are required to access the smart recommendation service. For specific field requirements, please refer to the following "Data Field Description":

1. Product table (product): synchronize all product information of the access scene;
2. User table (user): To synchronize all user information, the uniqueness of the user needs to be guaranteed, and the user id information is carried when requesting the service;
3. User behavior table (behavior): Synchronize historical and incremental user behavior data. It is recommended to provide 6-12 months of historical behavior data. The longer the synchronization time, the better the effect;

### **Data synchronization method**

Data synchronization includes offline data and incremental data. It supports synchronization through API interface, SDK or public cloud object storage. Among them:

- Offline data: need to provide product data, user data and historical user behavior data;

**Remarks:** Commodity data and user data are recommended to send day-level data snapshots. If there is no snapshot, then the latest data will be sent; Behavior data is synchronized at the day level; Commodity data, user data and behavior data are synchronized in json format. Each row of the data is json, corresponding to a record;

- Incremental data: Incremental product data, user data, and user behavior data need to be provided;

**Remarks:** ① Real-time incremental synchronization of behavioral data and product data is strongly recommended; ② User attribute data can be synchronized in increments of days;

### **Data field description**

The following are the specific field requirements of the user, product, and user behavior table. Whether it is mandatory to include three types: "Yes", "Suggestion" and "No". It is recommended to upload as much as possible. The more fields available for the algorithm model, the better the effect of the model.

### **Data synchronization**

Data synchronization supports synchronization through [API interface](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/4462/38312/) , [SDK](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/4462/39599/) or public cloud object storage.

- If the amount of offline data is large, support customers to dump the data to public cloud object storage, and we will pull it through the public network
- The offline data synchronization solution of the privatization deployment plan is more flexible and supports the direct pull of HDFS directories
- The data to be synchronized includes offline data and incremental data. The synchronization method is described as follows:
- Offline data: need to provide product data, user data and historical user behavior data
- Commodity data and user data are recommended to send day-level data snapshots. If there is no snapshot, then the latest data will be sent
- Behavior data is synchronized at the day level
- Commodity data, user data, and behavioral data are synchronized in JSON format. Each row of the data is JSON, corresponding to a record
- Incremental data: Incremental product data, user data, and user behavior data need to be provided;
- Real-time incremental synchronization of behavioral data and product data is strongly recommended
- User attribute data can be synchronized in increments of days

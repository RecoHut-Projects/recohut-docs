# Problem Statement

Imagine a customer visits a store to buy hardware parts (e.g. a PVC  pipe or a concrete block) and describe the requirements in a natural language like `'I need 2" x 5" concrete block'` but the exact description of this part might be different in the seller's database e.g. `'concrete block solid of width 2 inch and height 5 inches'`. So the objective is to build a system that will help the store owner to find and offer the right item from the database for the description given by the customer. 

# Proposed Solution

Semantic text similarity to map the queries. Bag-of-words based Count vectorizer model with different types of tokenization process and n-gram range. 

# Modeling Approach

### Data Description

Data 1 - Core training data with 2 columns - Part ID and Description, to find top similar queries

Data 2 - Lookup data to find the top most similar query

Data 3 - Lookup data to fetch the exact description if description is exactly matching in the database

Data 4 - List of keywords for a tokenizer

Data 5 - List of substitutions for more accurate similarity

Data 6 - Test data with 2 columns - Description and part ID (optional)

### Modeling

Count vectorizer models

- Unigram, Bigram and Trigram tokens
- Non-alphabet tokens
- Keyword tokens
- M1 - Text similarity model trained on small file
- M2 - Text similarity model trained on large file
- M3 - Text similarity model trained on mixed file

### Algorithm

- 1-gram and 2-gram tokenization
- Count vectorization
- Cosine or Euclidean distance
